# Long time no see 

Since my LinuxNote Book not have Chinese input methods so I decided to write my posts in English since now from future .

Alaa , it's been a long time since the last last time I wrote blog !!

6-15 is the last time I wrote blog , and now is 11-10 , about 5 months ago www ~

About the Graduate-exam , i get riddle of that bull shit , I will explore the life what I am loving about , not other guys telling me what I should do or something is great or not , I have not registered the Graduate-exam :D , and I love my decision ! Currently, About 3-4 months hard work I can create websites using Vue Pinia Router , and mastered JavaScript etc. and I did some dummy projects but which represent my innovation and the way that I am going through from ago to now. From Zero to the guys who really know what I am wanting and Loving . Now, I have the bird eyes to the future of my life ,and not confusion like before , and I finally realize that I am the guy who really can create something ,and the field that HE is loving at !! 

Really, I really think that the Web Development is really fun and enjoyable , and have the ability to create something and using that things I created to solve the problem what I am encountered in real life ! and I finally have the things and ability to make money(THOUGH I DID NOT REALLY LIKE WORK JUST FOR MONEY !!)

I love the felling that Solving the Problem in the Web Development , and I'd like to see that the progressive of my improvement ! From FontEnd to BackEnd ! and as long as I lean BackEnd I am not felling boring and I know I will become the guy who can really solve the problem and create a lot of interesting application ! and see I am on the way of what I planned before ! I am graduating improving ~

And don't forget do the thing that you want to do , don't let other guys grumble about the life which is not have any intersection about his life !

And the most important thing is , don't think life frustrating things , life is really awesome ! and have a mountain of grate things to felling ! when you're getting lost , just stop a moment and hear the heart voice . Take up head see the Sky , take a big breath in the middle of the night . you will find out , in the world you are not something special , and I am just a normal person in the world , but I am trying my best to let my normal life become more shining ~~
